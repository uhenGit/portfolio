# Portfolio page

* No libraries
* No frameworks
* Only HTML, CSS and JavaScript

It contains several pages with contacts, work and study experience, and project examples.
Every project block on the corresponding page has a screenshot, a link to the GitHub repository,
and a link to the deployed project (if it has so).
