          <p>
            My biography has never dealt with web development. But in almost
            every job I had to maintain the local network or even make
            correctionsto the corporate website. I even wrote a small Perl
            script once. That "program" calculates communal payments when I
            entered data in the terminal. Finally I understand what I want to
            do...

          <h3>IT School LevelUP</h3>
          <h6>Web-Development</h6>
          <p>
            As a complete beginner I need to learn basic principles and
            structure of simple websites. For this, a Web course program from
            the IT School LevelUP was perfect. It consisted of lessons in
            <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5,</abbr>
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS3</abbr>, JavaScript (with a
            little bit jQuery) and WordPress.

          <h3>SoloLearn</h3>
          <h6>Web app for self educating</h6>
          <p>
            In parallel with training in IT School I discovered a mobile
            application, called SoloLearn. Great cources, challenges and sandbox
            allowed Me to study and practice without being at the computer. Off
            course, I collected number of sertificates from this great
            application (like Basic course of HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript etc).

          <h3>Distance learning with a mentor</h3>
          <h6>Extended JavaScript course</h6>
          <p>
            Afetr studing at IT School, it's time to learn the methods of
            developing large dynamic projects. I choose JavaScript as the main
            development language. For both sides of web development (frontend
            and backend). With a great mentor, I took a course that included
            functions, libraries, NodeJS, view engines, ExpressJS, MongoDB,
            ReactJS, AngularJS and VueJS.
