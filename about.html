          <p>
            I am a professional with valuable commercial experience gained at Freshcode,
            where I contributed to an impressive serverless healthcare project spanning nearly two years.
            My role involved utilizing a cutting-edge technology stack, including Vue2, Firebase, Quasar,
            and various third-party libraries for advanced functionalities such as charting and PDF data export.
            Additionally, I participated in the successful migration of the project to Vue3,
            showcasing my adaptability and commitment to staying at the forefront of web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about participating in the development of modern, top-notch web applications,
            services, and platforms, driven by my belief in the World Wide Web's pivotal role
            in shaping the future of commerce and diverse services.

          <h3>IT School LevelUP</h3>
          <h6>Web-Development</h6>
          <p>
            As a complete beginner, I need to learn the basic principles and
            structure of simple websites. For this, a Web course program from
            the IT School LevelUP was perfect. It consisted of lessons in
            <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5,</abbr>
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS3</abbr>, JavaScript (with a
            little bit jQuery) and WordPress.

          <p>
            In parallel with training in IT School, I discovered a mobile
            application, called SoloLearn. Great courses, challenges, and sandbox
            allowed Me to study and practice without being at the computer. Of
            course, I collected a number of certificates from this fantastic
            application (like a Basic course in HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, etc.).

          <p>
            After studying at IT School, it's time to learn how to develop large
            dynamic projects. I chose JavaScript as the primary development language.
            For both sides of web development (frontend and backend).
            With a great mentor, I took a course that included functions, libraries,
            NodeJS, view engines, ExpressJS, MongoDB, ReactJS, AngularJS and VueJS.
