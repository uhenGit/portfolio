        Introducing my minimalist yet powerful todo application, meticulously crafted with React.js 
        and bolstered by the reliability of TypeScript, Redux, and seamless integration with 
        the browser's local storage functionality. Seamlessly blending modern technologies, 
        this intuitive application offers a streamlined interface for managing your tasks with ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the heart of this application lie two distinct tabs, each tailored to optimize your productivity. 
        The first tab showcases a comprehensive list of todos, whether active or completed, 
        providing a clear overview of your tasks at hand. Meanwhile, the second tab houses soft-deleted todos, 
        offering the flexibility to either permanently remove them or effortlessly restore them 
        to your active list, ensuring no task is ever lost or forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the robustness of Redux managing state, users can effortlessly add, remove, and toggle 
        the completion status of their todos, all while enjoying the benefits of type safety 
        and enhanced code readability provided by TypeScript. Additionally, the integration with browser's 
        local storage ensures that your todo list is automatically saved, providing a hassle-free experience 
        across sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're organizing your daily tasks, planning long-term goals, or simply seeking productivity 
        in your day-to-day life, this todo application empowers you to stay organized and focused, all within 
        a clean and efficient user interface.
